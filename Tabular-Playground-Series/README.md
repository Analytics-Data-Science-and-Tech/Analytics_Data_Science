In this repository, we store the code that we developed in the different tabular playground monthly competitions.

## Tabular Playground Sep-2022

The task for this month's competitions is a bit more complicated. Not only are there six countries and four books to forecast, but you're being asked to forecast sales during the tumultuous year 2021. Can you use your data science skills to predict book sales when conditions are far from the ordinary? 

For this challenge, you will be predicting a full year worth of sales for 4 items from two competing stores located in six different countries. This dataset is completely fictional, but contains many effects you see in real-world data, e.g., weekend and holiday effect, seasonality, etc. You are given the challenging task of predicting book sales during the year 2021.
