## Forecasting Traffic Flow in US Metropolis

For the March edition of the 2022 Tabular Playground Series you're challenged to forecast twelve-hours of traffic flow in a U.S. metropolis. The time series in this dataset are labelled with both location coordinates and a direction of travel -- a combination of features that will test your skill at spatio-temporal forecasting within a highly dynamic traffic network.

## House Prices - Adavanced Regression Techniques

Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence. With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.

## American Express - Default Prediction

Whether out at a restaurant or buying tickets to a concert, modern life counts on the convenience of a credit card to make daily purchases. It saves us from carrying large amounts of cash and also can advance a full purchase that can be paid over time. How do card issuers know we’ll pay back what we charge? That’s a complex problem with many existing solutions—and even more potential improvements, to be explored in this competition.

Credit default prediction is central to managing risk in a consumer lending business. Credit default prediction allows lenders to optimize lending decisions, which leads to a better customer experience and sound business economics. Current models exist to help manage risk. But it's possible to create better models that can outperform those currently in use. For more info see [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/amex-default-prediction)
